The corrected CSS code uses CSS custom properties (variables) for proper referencing within the `content` property:

```css
:root {
  --content: "This is some text";
}

.element::before {
  content: var(--content);
}
```

By defining `--content` in the `:root` selector, it becomes accessible throughout the stylesheet.  Using `var(--content)` correctly inserts the variable's value into the `content` property, ensuring the text is displayed as expected.
